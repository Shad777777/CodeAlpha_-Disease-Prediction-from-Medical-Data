# 🩺 Disease Prediction from Medical Data

## 📌 Objective
Predict the possibility of diseases based on patient medical data.

## 🔬 Approach
We apply **classification techniques** on structured medical datasets to analyze patient health conditions and predict the likelihood of diseases.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Use features such as **symptoms, age, blood test results, etc.**
- ✅ Implement popular ML algorithms:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- ✅ Datasets used:
  - Heart Disease
  - Diabetes
  - Breast Cancer  
  *(from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/))*
- ✅ Data preprocessing & feature scaling pipeline
- ✅ Model training, evaluation, and comparison
- ✅ Visualization of results and performance metrics
- ✅ Easy-to-use Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

📊 Example Results

Logistic Regression Accuracy: XX%
Random Forest Accuracy: XX%
XGBoost Accuracy: XX%

📌 Future Work
Extend to more diseases with larger datasets
Apply deep learning (ANNs, CNNs)
Deploy model as a web app using Flask/Streamlit
